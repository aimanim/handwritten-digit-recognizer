## Comparative Analysis of Handwritten Digit Recognition Models
This project aims to compare the performance and accuracy of various deep learning models in the task of handwritten digit recognition. The models used include **Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)**, **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**. The are compared on the same dataset i.e. MNIST. 
The performance metrics measured for comparison include training accuracy and loss, test accuracy and loss, precision, recall, f1-score and their respective confusion matrices.
