## Handwritten Digit Recognizer

This project uses the custom Tkinter library in Python to create the GUI for the handwritten digit recognizer. This application uses a CNN model trained on the MNIST dataset to detect the digits. User has the option to draw an digit on the canvas and the system can recognize the digit drawn.
The user can also select any image from the MNIST dataset to test the model. Performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, precision, recall and ROC curve can also be viewed using the GUI. The application saves the model once trained so it doesn't have to be retrained each time we run the program.
